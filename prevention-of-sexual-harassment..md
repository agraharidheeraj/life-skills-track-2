# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## Overview

This README outlines information about sexual harassment, its various forms, and what steps I take when i am facing or witnessing such behavior in the workplace.

## What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes a range of offensive sexual behaviors that create an unpleasant or uncomfortable environment. These behaviors primarily take three forms:

1. **Verbal Harassment:** This includes making sexual or gender-based jokes, inappropriate comments about someone's appearance, requesting sexual favors, engaging in sexual innuendos, spreading rumors about a person's personal or sexual life, using offensive language, and making threats.

2. **Visual Harassment:** Involves sharing sexually explicit images, posters, cartoons, emails, or texts that create a hostile work environment due to their explicit or offensive content.

3. **Physical Harassment:** This includes unwanted physical contact, such as touching, hugging, kissing, patting, stroking, or even sexual assault. It can also involve gestures or leering that make someone uncomfortable.

These forms of harassment can be categorized into two primary types: "Quid pro quo" and "Hostile work environment." Quid pro quo harassment occurs when a superior forces a subordinate into relationships or sexual behaviors by using the rewards or consequences of their employment. Hostile work environment harassment happens when offensive behavior interferes with an employee's ability to perform their job or creates an intimidating and offensive atmosphere at work.

## What to do when facing or witnessing such behavior?

In the event of facing or witnessing sexual harassment, follow these steps to address the situation and ensure a safe and respectful work environment:

1. **Report the Incident:** If I am victim or a witness, report the incident to my HR department or the designated authority within my organization. And I Provide a detailed account of the harassment, including the date, time, location, and individuals involved.

2. **Document Evidence:** I Keep records of any evidence, such as emails, text messages, or witness statements, to support my case.

3. **Seek Support:** I Reach out to my friends, colleagues, or family members for emotional support during this challenging time.

4. **Know Your Rights:** Familiarize myself with my legal rights and protections against sexual harassment. Consult with legal counsel if necessary.

5. **Follow Company Procedures:** Many organizations have specific procedures in place for handling harassment complaints. I Follow these procedures, which may involve investigations, disciplinary actions.

6. **Contact External Authorities:** Contact external authorities like an ombudsman, an equal employment opportunity commission, or a qualified government body if my organisation is unable to resolve the issue or if the harassment continues.

7. **Consider Legal Action:** If all else fails, consult with a lawyer about the possibilities of filing a lawsuit against the harasser and my company for failing to take necessary action.
