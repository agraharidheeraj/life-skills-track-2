# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## Questions:

* What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment includes a range of offensive sexual behaviours that make an environment unpleasant or uncomfortable. Sexual harassment primarily takes the following three forms: verbal, visual, and physical.

1-Verbal Harassment: This includes making sexual or gender-based jokes, inappropriate comments about someone's appearance, requesting sexual favors, engaging in sexual innuendos, spreading rumors about a person's personal or sexual life, using offensive language, and making threats.

2-Visual Harassment: This involves sharing sexually explicit images, posters, cartoons, emails, or texts, creating a hostile work environment with their explicit or offensive content.

3-Physical Harassment: Physical harassment includes unwanted physical contact such as touching, hugging, kissing, patting, stroking, or even sexual assault. It can also involve gestures or leering that make someone uncomfortable.

The two primary categories of these sorts of harassment are "Quid pro quo" and "Hostile work environment." 
Quid pro quo harassment happens when a superior forces a subordinate into relationships or sexual behaviours by using the rewards or consequences of their employment.
Hostile work environment harassment happens when offensive behavior interferes with an employee's ability to perform their job or creates an intimidating and offensive atmosphere at work.
